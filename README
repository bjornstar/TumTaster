TumTaster v0.5.0 -- http://tumtaster.bjornstar.com
By Bjorn Stromberg (@bjornstar)

TumTaster adds download links to posts and also keeps a playlist of all the tracks that you've seen. As of v0.5.0 it also tries to read soundcloud tracks. Unfortunately, most soundcloud tracks cannot be downloaded through their API.

TumTaster uses SoundManager2 for managing MP3 playback. You can get more information about SoundManager2 at: http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2
